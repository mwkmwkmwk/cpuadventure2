This exploit is semi-automatic â€” it requires manually playing through part 
of the game, to prepare proper state for the exploit.  To use it:

1. Run python3 h4x.py <server ip>
2. Kill two blue dragons and one white dragon, have two redbulls and one vodka in inventory
3. Go one square to the left of valis
4. Select the drop command, select redbulls in the menu
5. When asked for item count, press Ctrl-K to launch the exploit.

To kill a dragon without being killed yourself, you need to abuse the speed
system in the game: you have 4 moves for every 3 moves of a dragon, thus
allowing you to avoid getting hit by timing your own attacks correctly.
